# Raspberry Pi Sensor Node

## Project Overview
This project involves building a Raspberry Pi-based sensor node that measures temperature and humidity using a DHT sensor, publishes the data to an MQTT broker, and sends it to a RESTful web service.

## Features
- Measures temperature and humidity using a DHT11 sensor.
- Publishes sensor data to an MQTT broker.
- Sends data to a RESTful web service.
- Node-RED and Streamsheets integration.

## Folder Structure
code/: Contains the Python scripts for sensor data collection and communication.
docs/: Contains the technical description, screenshots, and references.
node-red/: Contains the Node-RED flow for MQTT and RESTful web service integration.
streamsheets/: Contains configuration files for Streamsheets integration.
